# Kong Konnect Enterprise
## The Service Connectivity Platform

### End-to-end service connectivity
The platform integrates an API gateway, service mesh and ingress to provide end-to-end service connectivity across the full API lifecycle. It is the only platform that provides end-to-end connectivity between services within applications and across applications as well as exposes services at the edge.

### Architectural freedom
You can abstract network and security concerns from services so that developers can focus on building apps instead of pipes. Kong connects services across any cloud, any platform and any modern protocol such as REST, GraphQL, gRPC and Kafka.

### Hybrid and multi-cloud
You want to deploy services in cloud computing resources closer to the physical business locations for performance, cost, privacy and regulatory compliance reasons. With Kong Konnect you can deploy APIs in a 100% consistent manner across any infrastructure and any deployment pattern such as hybrid or multi-cloud configurations.

### Kubernetes native
You can deploy Konnect in Kubernetes via the Kong Kubernetes Ingress Controller to manage microservices and APIs natively through Kubernetes CRDs. You can automate deployment tasks and ensure consistency of configurations with GitOps.

### Extensible
Konnect’s core is fully extensible, and you can build your own custom plugins to complement the many out-of-box policies that are available with the open source or enterprise edition.

### Fast, scalable and secure
Konnect runtimes are lightweight, fast by design and remove bloat from each service. You can seamlessly scale up and down services and secure them with policies that enforce zero-trust security.

### Automation
Konnect enables declarative configuration by generating a configuration file for Kong, via Kubernetes Ingress or the Kong Gateway, and pushing it into a CI/CD pipeline via GitSync to provide a single version of the truth and to optimize DevOps and GitOps practices
