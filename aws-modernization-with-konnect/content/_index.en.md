In this workshop you will learn why API Gateway is a pattern for modernization and how to use patterns with Kong to:

*   Decentralize Applications and Services - Break down monoliths into services or build new applications with distributed architectures to accelerate your journey to microservices, Kubernetes and Service Mesh. 
*   Secure and Govern APIs and Services - Provide consistent security, governance, and compliance across APIs and services.
*   Create a Developer Platform - Provide an internal developer platform built for distributed architectures.
*   Offload critical and complex processing out of services and microservices.

Konnect is an API lifecycle management platform designed from the ground up for the cloud native era and delivered as a service. This platform lets you build modern applications better, faster, and more securely. The management plane is hosted in the cloud by Kong, while the runtime engine, Kong Gateway — Kong’s lightweight, fast, and flexible API gateway — is managed by you within your preferred network environment.
