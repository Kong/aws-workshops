Every organization is under pressure to innovate by providing compelling digital experiences. Organizations overcome this challenge through applications that are built with modern architectures using microservices and containers, managed through Kubernetes. These modern methods deliver the agility needs of the businesses.

Organizations break down legacy monolithic applications into smaller modern services, or they build new
cloud native apps using microservices. The number of APIs is exploding, and connectivity between services becomes the critical backbone of your applications.

Kong Gateway helps address these challenges by providing reliable, secure and observable connectivity for all services across any infrastructure. The platform provides full lifecycle API management to:

* Design, test and document APIs and microservices
