# AWS Modernization Workshop with Kong

![kong](/images/kong.png)


### Welcome

In this workshop you will learn why API Gateway is a pattern for modernization and how to use patterns with Kong to:

*   Decentralize Applications and Services - Break down monoliths into services or build new applications with distributed architectures to accelerate your journey to microservices, Kubernetes and Service Mesh. 
*   Secure and Govern APIs and Services - Provide consistent security, governance, and compliance across APIs and services.
*   Create a Developer Platform - Provide an internal developer platform built for distributed architectures.
*   Offload critical and complex processing out of services and microservices.

Kong Konnect Enterprise is a Service Connectivity platform that provides technology teams at multi-cloud and hybrid organizations the “architectural freedom” to build APIs and services anywhere. Kong’s Service Connectivity Platform provides a ﬂexible, technology-agnostic platform that supports any cloud, platform, protocol and architecture. Kong Konnect Enterprise supports the full lifecycle of service management, enabling users to easily design, test, secure, deploy, monitor, monetize and version their APIs.
