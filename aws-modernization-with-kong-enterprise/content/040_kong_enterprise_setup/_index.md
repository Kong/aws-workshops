# Setting up Kong

Kong Gateway Enterprise can be used with or without a license, or on "Free Mode". For Enterprise functionality, Kong Gateway enforces the presence and validity of a Kong Konnect license file.

You can check Kong Gateway licensing and "Free Mode" capabilities here: https://docs.konghq.com/enterprise/2.4.x/deployment/licensing/

This is a "Free Mode" deployment based on Kong Gateway Enterprise 2.4. Please contact Kong to get a Kong Enterprise trial license to use its Enterprise features.
