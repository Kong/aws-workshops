It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your laptop for this workshop.
We will use Amazon Cloud9 to access our AWS accounts via the AWS CLI in this Workshop.</description>
